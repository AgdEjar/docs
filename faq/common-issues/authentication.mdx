## OAuth Token Issues

### Invalid Client Credentials
**Problem**: Receiving `401 Unauthorized` response when requesting an access token.

**Solution**:
1. Verify your `client_id` and `client_secret` are correct
2. Make sure you're using HTTPS
3. Check that your credentials haven't expired
4. Ensure the Authorization header is properly formatted
