## Getting Started

If you lucky, you might come across original Ejar's API documentation,you noticed:
- You need a permession to access it from whitelisted IPs.
- Not well written and not easy to understand.
- You need to call multiple endpoints to get the data you need.
- Not all endpoints are available.
- No code examples.

By using our APIs, you will facilitate your integration with Ejar.sa by:
- A single endpoint to get all the data you need.
- Easy to understand documentation.
- No need to worry about whitelisted IPs.
- Code examples in many languages (soon).
- We will keep our API up to date with Ejar's changes.
- You'll get extra integrations with other services out of the box.
- You can focus on building your product and we will take care maintaining the rest.

Our goal is to make it easy for you to integrate with Ejar.sa without the hassle.

## Partners
You are fully integrated with:
- Ejar : National portal for e-contracts
- Saudi Post (SPL) : Validating national address
- Ministry of Justice : Validating deeds & proxies
- Minstery of Commerce : Validating commercial registry
- National Information center (Ministry of Interior) : Validating IDs

All of thiese services are essentals to the contract registration process. By default, you'll be able to use all these services without any extra configuration.
